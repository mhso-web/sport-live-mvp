    homeAnalysis: `## ${homeTeam} Team Analysis

${homeTeam} enters this fixture with strong momentum from their pre-season preparations. The home advantage at ${venue} will be crucial, as they have maintained an impressive record at their fortress.

### Key Strengths:
- **Home Form**: Unbeaten in last 5 home matches across all competitions
- **Squad Depth**: Quality options in every position allowing tactical flexibility
- **Set Pieces**: Dangerous from corners and free-kicks with multiple aerial threats
- **Pressing Game**: High-intensity pressing to disrupt opposition build-up

### Recent Performance:
The team has shown excellent cohesion in pre-season, winning 3 of their 5 friendlies. New signings have integrated well, particularly in midfield where the team now has better balance and creativity.

### Tactical Approach:
Expected to dominate possession and territory, ${homeTeam} will look to establish control early. The wide players will be key in stretching the opposition defense, creating space for central runners.`,

    awayAnalysis: `## ${awayTeam} Team Analysis

${awayTeam} faces a challenging away fixture but comes prepared with a well-drilled defensive setup and dangerous counter-attacking options.

### Key Strengths:
- **Defensive Organization**: Compact shape difficult to break down
- **Counter-attacking**: Quick transitions with pacey forwards
- **Team Spirit**: Strong collective mentality and work ethic
- **Aerial Ability**: Threat from set pieces both defensively and offensively

### Recent Performance:
Mixed pre-season results but showed glimpses of quality, particularly in victories against strong opposition. The team has focused on defensive solidity while maintaining attacking threat.

### Tactical Approach:
Likely to adopt a pragmatic approach, sitting deeper and looking to exploit spaces on the counter. Wing-backs will be crucial in providing width while maintaining defensive stability.`,

    tacticalAnalysis: `## Tactical Analysis

### Formation Battle
${homeTeam}'s 4-3-3 vs ${awayTeam}'s 4-4-2 creates interesting tactical dynamics. The home side will have numerical superiority in midfield, but the visitors' compact shape could frustrate their build-up play.

### Key Battles
1. **Midfield Control**: ${homeTeam}'s extra midfielder should dominate possession
2. **Wide Areas**: Space for ${homeTeam}'s wingers vs ${awayTeam}'s narrow shape
3. **Defensive Line**: ${awayTeam} likely to defend deep, ${homeTeam} pushing high
4. **Set Pieces**: Both teams have aerial threats making dead balls crucial

### Expected Game Flow
${homeTeam} will likely dominate early possession, probing for openings. ${awayTeam} will be patient, looking to frustrate and hit on the break. The first goal will be crucial in determining the match's tactical evolution.`,

    predictionSummary: `Based on comprehensive analysis of form, head-to-head records, and tactical matchups, ${homeTeam} enters as favorites. Their home advantage and superior recent record against ${awayTeam} makes them likely winners.

However, ${awayTeam}'s defensive organization and counter-attacking threat means this won't be straightforward. The match will likely be decided by fine margins - a set piece, individual error, or moment of brilliance.

**Match Result Prediction**: ${homeTeam} Win (65% confidence)
**Score Prediction**: ${homeTeam} 2-1 ${awayTeam}
**Goals**: Over 2.5 goals likely (70% confidence)
**Both Teams to Score**: Yes (60% confidence)

The first goal will be crucial. If ${homeTeam} scores early, expect them to control the game. If ${awayTeam} keeps it tight past 30 minutes, they grow in confidence and the match becomes more open.`,
